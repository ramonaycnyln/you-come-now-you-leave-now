        <div class="body-text">
            <p>It’s impossible not to take the people we love for granted. All that appreciation just to get through the day. How could we live? But there are a few things I would have done differently if I could go back. I would have insisted we stand in line to see where the Constitution was signed when my dad came to visit me in Philadelphia four months before his death instead of asking, “Do you really wanna wait?” I would have worked harder to loosen up when we went to Iceland on our last trip together. I would have taken more videos. Pictures are great, but videos bring a person to life in a way that I never even thought about before I realized I’d never see him in motion again. I only have a few, and I don’t play them often. I don’t want to build up tolerance to his ghost.</p>

            <p>The time-stamp on one of them says it was taken at 9 pm on February 8, 2023, one month before he died. My dad, sitting in his red recliner, is the only person in the frame, but I know my mom and our longtime family friend Cathy are there too. Over the months of his illness, the wooden table next to the recliner had slowly filled up with all of his little items: incentive spirometer, headlamp, his weed vape in the elegant holder he’d made from a square of 2x4. Mugs and glasses of unknown contents. Drinking was easier than eating by then, and he always had several beverages going at once.</p>

            <p>You can hear in my halting breaths that I’ve been crying or still am. I don’t remember taking the video. I’m sure I’d taken an Ambien, which I was doing a lot. (You can add that to my list of regrets.)</p>

            <p>Cathy tells my dad that he will continue to live in her memory as long as she’s alive. He doesn’t appear to take much comfort in this, saying that while he may be remembered for her lifetime, by the next generation – “In which we have absolutely no oar in the water” – “I’ll be gone.”</p>

            <p>Although my dad has apparently forgotten that we do have an oar, and she is sitting right in front of him, I seem to take his meaning. “Should I have a baby?” I earnestly ask the room at large. I’m roundly ignored. It wasn’t until this year that I ever really thought about the fact that, absent some intervention, I’ll be the last person in our family. I’m a childless only child in my mid-30s without even a single cousin. This has started to become intermittently terrifying. I remember sifting through boxes of family photos as a kid, asking, who’s that? Hearing how my grandfather called my grandmother, Helen, his little hurricane. Who will I tell our stories to?</p>
            <p>Several months after my dad’s death, the father of an investigator on the study I work on died. During a meeting, a couple of months before, he had told the group that he might be less available for a bit. His parents were ill, and he didn’t know how it would all shake out. I had told him I understood. That my dad had recently died after several years of illness. I remember how he’d looked at me sharply, and said, “We’re not there yet.” I’d been trying to empathize but, on some level, he’d taken it as a threat. This is what’s coming for you. And now his father is dead, and when I write him a condolence note I wonder if there’s some part of him that thinks I’m saying, I told you so. And I wonder if there’s some part of me that is. Grief doesn’t make you a good person. It just makes you a different person.</p>

            <p>It’s a bright blue day in Iceland, and we’re headed west along a peninsula that we refer to as, “Snuffles” because we couldn’t pronounce the Icelandic word and Snuffles is funny. This is our favorite kind of humor. The kind where you just laugh at words. It’s September, the fall before his death, and we’re on what we had enthusiastically declared “our last trip.” This wasn’t because we’d come to a circumspect acceptance of his mortality, but so that my mom would be guilted into turning a blind eye to the exorbitant amount of money we hoped to spend.</p>
    
            <p>That morning, he’d had another neuropathy related foot-slip while driving, and I’d taken over again. It probably would’ve been fine, but I hadn’t wanted to worry the whole time. (This is of course the thought process that causes caregivers to start preemptively doing everything for their charges.) I was feeling annoyed because he, thinking he’d be doing most of the driving, had insisted we get a manual, even though I hadn’t driven one since high school. I was sad too. He’d always been such an elegant driver: cocking his head just so and raising two fingers from the wheel at a passing acquaintance, turning his palm toward the shifter and pushing rather than pulling it into fourth, decelerating so smoothly you hardly noticed you’d stopped.</p>
    
            <p>He was still a terrible backseat driver, but his suggestions were so earnest and idiosyncratic that it was moderately annoying instead of homicidally so. Still, I had to tell him to seriously stop after he said I wasn’t wiggling the gear shift the right way when checking whether the car was in neutral. The crazy thing was that I was doing it “the right way” – placing my hand loosely over the ball and giving it a rapid jiggle. It was a move I executed flawlessly because I’d watched him do it a thousand times.</p>
    
            <p>It was a small thing, but the fact that he’d missed this detail showed his decline. There’s a possibly apocryphal story about a man throwing a punch over a game of pool and my dad catching the guy’s fist in his hand. Whether or not it’s true, it’s believable because it illustrates one of his most marked characteristics. He was unusually observant. He noticed the moment the guy started to swing.</p>
    
            <p>At his funeral, my mom told me that the most frequent thing people said to her after my dad died was that they liked him but never really “got” him. He lived on the same end of the same Pacific Northwest island for 48 years, and going anywhere with him included a stream of nods, hellos, and fingers raised from the steering wheel, but he had only a few close friends. He liked people and loved to chat but could quickly go from affable to far away. At dinner parties you’d look over and see him staring dreamily into the middle distance. “Is your dad okay?” I remember a friend asking one year at Thanksgiving. He wandered, and not just in his mind. You’d be on a trip walking around some foreign city and suddenly he'd be gone. This was very annoying, as was his response to being called on it. “What? I was just over there,” he’d say, gesturing vaguely away.</p>
    
            <p>He was a specific kind of person, but it would be hard to say which kind. He had a dry sense of humor but wasn’t sarcastic. He was mischievous but almost never unkind. He had an easy physicality, probably from the years he spent outdoors chopping wood for a living, but he couldn’t have cared less about sports. He loved animals. Dogs especially. He always gave our late dog Bella the last bite of whatever he was eating. The effect was that he started hurrying through his food, becoming more and more anxious as she stared at him expectantly. Only once she had received that final bite could he relax.</p>
    
            <p>He taught middle school for years, and one of his most strongly held convictions was that children shouldn’t spend all day sitting in a classroom. One of his classes was called Adventure Education and it culminated each semester in a week-long outdoor trip. I went along on one during my junior year of college. It started with a 36-hour train ride from Seattle to Southern California with 16 eighth graders and only got more harrowing from there. I swore I would never do it again, but he loved those trips and could remember them in elaborate detail even years later, always referring to his former students by their last names as he recalled the little quirks of their personalities. He took children seriously as people, which is probably why so many of his students adored him. A few absolutely hated him, and he got a kick out of that too.</p>
    
            <p>After he died, my mom showed me a piece of worn yellow paper with a list of names written in his distinctive all caps handwriting. He’d told her that these were people who had been especially kind to him during his illness. During his last few weeks, she would frequently see him gazing at it, or sometimes just holding it in his hand with his eyes closed.</p>
    
            <p>—</p>
    
            <p>Has anyone you loved ever died really slowly? Toward the end of my dad’s life, I told my therapist Roger that sometimes I wished he would just die already. It had been over two years since his diagnosis, which is not even really that long, but I was tired of the false alarms, the dire phone calls and emergency trips home, sobbing in the gynecologist's office because my mom had just called to tell me that he’d decided to take the medication cocktail he’d been prescribed for when he was ready to go, but by the time I got to the airport that afternoon, he’d changed his mind.</p>
    
            <p>Roger said this was the kind of thing people usually keep to themselves, but he was smiling because he loves this kind of stuff. He paused, seeming to weigh what he was about to say, and then told me that his first wife had died suddenly of a brain aneurysm. A week later at the wake he had caught his son laughing. Or at least his son felt caught. The color drained from his face when he looked up and saw his dad see him, but Roger had told his son what he tells me now, “Don’t ever apologize for living. Life wants to be lived.”</p>
    
            <p>We celebrated what would be my dad’s last birthday on a balcony in Reykjavik. Seventy-four years old, and a plate of fresh bread, apples, Camembert, and a sliced Snickers bar. We toasted with Coke Zero in wine glasses, both of us wrapped in gray blankets against the evening chill. The trip was almost over, and I was feeling bad for how irritable I’d been. Annoyed at his memory loss and then guilty for being annoyed.</p>
    
            <p>I don’t remember what preceded it, but he started talking about how he had become invisible in old age. He said he’d first noticed it when we were visiting New York City 15 years before. The feeling that no one noticed him or paid attention to him. That his physicality had gradually become less and less relevant in a world that places more value on youth and beauty.</p>
    
            <p>It was one of those conversations you try to avoid by pretending you’ve heard it all before. I could tell it was weighing on him, but I was so tired, so worn down by the relentless demands of his decline. At that moment, I was doing what I always do when confronted with his vulnerability—deflecting. I told him, “Dad, nobody cares. People are so self-absorbed, they don’t even notice.”</p>
    
            <p>But I didn’t say it in an unkind way. I was trying to make him feel better, to lessen the sting of that reality. But later I’d realize it was the last conversation we’d have. That it would be one of the final moments I could truly be with him, and instead of offering some comfort, I had tried to shut it down. I didn’t want to hear him talk about his aging body, because I wasn’t ready to think about what would come next.</p>
    
            <p>It was one of those moments I wished I could take back, but I can’t. Just like you can’t take back any of those little unkind moments we have with people we love. The moments when we fall short of what we think we should be. And sometimes that’s what gets us. Not the big things—though of course, they hurt—but the little things.</p>
    
            <p>—</p>
    
            <p>I had no idea that one of the last times we spoke I would be telling him about this trip that would become the last thing I ever did with him. But that trip had been important to him. It felt like a conclusion, an ending.</p>
    
            <p>My dad was a man who lived with no real fear of endings, and that’s what I loved about him. He could see endings in every little thing, and yet he didn’t let them stop him. The trick, I guess, is to be okay with both the beginnings and the endings. He taught me that even though, sometimes, endings are what break you.</p>
